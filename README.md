# Dart-Android

Every day life we need to add/update/delete something in the app. the main pain is we need to update our app and publish again and again.
dart give you bit relief.

How its work?

Dart is open source lib, dart through you can update any kind of value without re-publishing the application. just you need to maintain
json file on your server and whenever and whatever need ro update you just need to update the values in your remote json file and your 
app will sync automaticly and update new information
